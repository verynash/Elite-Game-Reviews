                    <h3>Bringing D&D to the mainstream</h3>
                    <p class="first-paragraph">It is no surprise that Baldur’s Gate III is receiving a five-star review from me. It just took home Game of the Year at the Game Awards, along with numerous other trophies. It is one of the best games I have ever played, and I personally nominated it for almost every category in the upcoming Steam Awards. Larian Studios have outdone themselves. Baldur’s Gate III is packed with content, surprising me even after almost 200 hours of gameplay. With seven playable origin characters including the Dark Urge on top of the create-your-own-adventure base story, this game refuses to go stale. It utilizes the classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons model and ruleset, and imports many of the races and classes. There are eleven base races, with subraces under those, and twelve unique classes, each of which can spec into a specialty of the player’s choosing. Whether you want to be a powerful human spellcaster, a devastatingly strong orc barbarian, a shape-shifting druid, or anything in between, the choice is yours. </p>
                    <p>As I mentioned, BG3 relies heavily on the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons. Using a semi-open world model, with four distinct locations, players have an incredible amount of choice in how their campaign will sort out. Dice rolls are used frequently, in conversation to persuade and intimidate, in chests and locks for picking chances, and of course, in combat. Combat is turn-based, and strategy is paramount, but the luck of the dice always plays its part. You can increase the odds of good dice rolls by increasing your stats and proficiencies, tilting the scale in your favor. </p>

                    <p class="first-paragraph">Surprisingly for a game that uses turn-based combat, BG3 makes massive steps forward in terms of realism, especially for the genre. In many other RPGs, you play as a character that can obliterate enemies, literally blowing them to pieces, but are stopped by the mighty wooden gate. BG3 fixes some of these inconsistencies by adding health points to almost every object in the game. Inanimate objects are guaranteed to get hit, but how much it matters changes based on what they're hitting. Larian also made strides in conversation. Some games, such as Spiderman 2, have set cutscenes that are the same no matter what happens during the game. The story is linear. In Baldur’s Gate III, nearly every conversation gives you options to express your character’s personality, and the NPCs react in a believable way. You can have unique conversation options based on your race, class, and background, as well as the many choices you make throughout the game. It’s not just the characters, either. The narrator herself has recorded 17 different styles of narration based upon the character(s) you are playing. </p>
                    <p>You cannot talk about Baldur’s Gate III without talking about the romance. It seems like every game tries to shoddily add a boilerplate romance into the games, with unimaginative and forgettable romantic leads. It often feels like an afterthought. Not here. Every one of your companions is romanceable, and each has their own charming and unique personality that shines only with you. Karlach is the sweetest, most fun-loving half-devil around. Wyll is a fantastic dancer. Shadowheart is dark and mysterious, yet sweet and affectionate. Astarion is witty and clever, sure to give you a laugh. One of my favorite romance options is Lae’zel, whose lack of human social norms and abrasive nature makes for a hilarious combination. No matter what your preference is, you’re sure to find a suitable companion. </p>

                    <p class="first-paragraph">As much as I adore the dialogue, a game does not win Game of the Year without excellent combat. Larian has stepped up their game this time. One thing I noticed early on was that the combat was really difficult. I did my first playthrough on the regular difficulty level, and I found myself dying far more often than I expected to. The first few levels are brutal. As you are trying to strengthen your character and find ideal team compositions to be your strongest group, you run into multiple fights that will leave your party bloodied if not dead. You quickly learn that you must separate your party members and position them optimally before a fight even begins. You are unaware of the strengths and weaknesses of the enemies at hand, especially if you’ve never played Dungeons and Dragons or a Larian game before, and the enemies throw constant curveballs for you to react to. I loved every second of it. As the game progresses, you get a feel for how the party should fight, you begin to think you have it figured out, and then out of nowhere you face a boss that completely upends your plans. Being quick on your feet and creative is necessary if you want to live to see another day. I did find that after one playthrough on the regular difficulty, I was able to step up to the harder difficulty and found it easier than my initial playthrough. There certainly is a learning curve, and it feels great to find stronger ways of whittling down your foes. I also found that every battle felt fresh upon a second playthrough, because the characters I was using were so different. Strategies don’t translate exactly from one party to the next, because the resources available to them are so different. I see every day new unique strategies people have found to conquer the toughest enemies with ease, and I cannot wait to find more of those myself. </p>
                    <p>There is one last topic I’d like to address. Larian Studios has been incredible post-launch. The game was released with some bugs, which is not uncommon considering how much content is available and the impossibility of guessing everything your players are going to attempt. Some people will try to break the game intentionally, and some will do it accidentally. Larian listened to the community and has been working tirelessly to release constant updates and bugfixes. The game officially launched for PC at the beginning of September, and they are already to their fifth major update, totaling over 5,000 bugfixes and changes, including an all-new epilogue, in less than two and a half months. The rate at which they are outputting new content is astounding, and they continue to churn it out. To everyone on the Baldur’s Gate III team, you have my genuine thanks. Thank you for putting together such a masterpiece for us all to enjoy. </p>
