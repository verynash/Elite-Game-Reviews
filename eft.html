                    <h3>The Hardcore Gamer's Dream</h3>
                    <p class="first-paragraph">Shooters have long been a staple of mainstream gaming. Ranging from the creative, like Splatoon and Ratchet and Clank, to the more realistic, like CS:GO and Call of Duty, shooters have made their way into nearly every demographic. For a long time, though, there was nothing out there that was truly life-like, with ARMA being the closest to achieving that goal. Enter Escape from Tarkov, a hyper realistic survival shooter set in a fictional region of Russia, Norvinsk. Battlestate Games prides themselves on offering the most hardcore experience for their players. </p>
                    <p>The player begins by dropping into one of several maps with one goal: escape. There is no heads up display, or HUD, and no minimap to help navigate the expansive maps. You can craft a paper map that your character can bring up, and then use landmarks to help navigate, but generally it’s all about exposure and memory. You do not drop in alone, however; there are other players spawning in around the map, as well as NPC enemies called “scavs,” short for scavengers. Scavs are always hostile, but other players may or may not be. You can test your luck trying to join up with other players using the proximity voice chat, but be weary; they may just be gunning for your gear. </p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p class="first-paragraph">Unlike many shooters, your inventory in Escape from Tarkov varies based on what you use and what you find. Anything you find is yours to keep, but if you do not exfiltrate, you lose everything on you. Because of this, you will likely see large swings in the value of your inventory. Sometimes you get a few good exfils in a row and end up with mounds of cash, weapons, and supplies. Other times you find yourself reduced to running around with a pistol and two magazines of ammo. This adds to the hardcore experience. There is always a risk when you sit down to play, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. For those that are not feeling lucky, you may also drop in as a scav yourself once every half hour or so. You drop in with random loot, and if you exfil, you keep everything. If you are unable to, you haven’t lost anything other than a little bit of your time. This is one way to always keep your inventory relatively full. </p>
                    <p class="first-paragraph">For some, the gameplay itself is the draw to Escape from Tarkov. The high-risk, high-reward is a draw for those who like to gamble a little bit. You have very little health and die instantly from a headshot. If you get shot in the limbs or fall from too high, you break bones and suffer expected repercussions. You can stint a broken leg to get back some of your movement and use medical kits to heal (up to a point). You have a wide range of tactical options to get the upper hand, whether it be your positioning or using the lean mechanic to peek behind walls. There is great attention to detail that Battlestate has put into this game. </p>
                    <p> Others stick around because of the care and time invested in customization. EFT boasts hundreds of unique weapons to find and use, along with explosives and tactical grenades to boot. Each weapon is a replica of a real-world weapon, with the same customization options. You can change the stocks, sights, grips, muzzles, thread caps, flashlights, infrared, even the barrels themselves. Different sights only fit certain mounts, and those mounts only fit certain weapons, just as they do outside of the game. You could spend dozens of hours studying weapons alone and still have much more to learn. For some this is overkill and could dissuade them from playing, but of course there are things to keep the game interesting for everyone. </p>

                    <p class="first-paragraph">There are traders that players have access to between raids. Each trader has his or her own set of missions for the player to complete to help provide progression. After you reach a certain point in a trader’s questline, you open many more items for purchase. These quests are often difficult, not only because of their inherent difficulty to accomplish when others are vying for the same resources or fighting over the same location, but also because many of the missions require you to exfiltrate to turn in your items. I have around a 12% exfil rate. For some reason I continue to play, though. </p>
                    <p>I would love to give this game a five-star review. I feel that the gameplay loop is solid. The customization options are beyond excellent. There is a thrill when you are racing to escape with hard-earned valuables, or with a giant backpack of goods that is so heavy your character can only walk at a snail’s pace. The implementation of multiplayer was well done, allowing you to create your dream assault team. There are just two unignorable issues: bugs and server issues. There are several bugs that pop up when you have as much content as Battlestate has brought us. Unfortunately, they are a small organization and do not have the manpower for maximum quality assurance or bug-fixing. The other, larger issue has to do with servers. One person hosts the game lobby for a large group of players. That one person has far faster connection speeds and therefore has an advantage in every firefight. Another issue is that some movements don’t render visually quickly enough. Many people know of and abuse the right peek around a wall. If you quickly lean to your right around a corner where just your head peeks out, and then release the lean, you have time to fire a shot or two off and the player you are shooting at will never see you. It simply does not render. If they fix that bug alone, this game would be five stars. For now, I will leave it at a well-deserved four stars, and would recommend this game to any hardcore gamers. </p>
