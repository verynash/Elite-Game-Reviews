                    <h3>A New Twist on the Classic Deckbuilder</h3>
                    <p class="first-paragraph">Deck builders have been around for years. Most have at least heard of the classics, like Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone, where two players build decks to take out the others' resources and health points. Slay the Spire adds a twist to this classic formula, pitting you against a plethora of enemies as you climb through the dangerous spire. Created by Seattle-based studio Mega Crit, Slay the Spire’s gameplay is based on defeating enemies to gain powerful rewards that help you tackle more and more powerful enemies. The game is a roguelite – your character’s progress will be reset if you die and the enemies are procedurally generated on each run, creating a new and different challenge every time you play. There are four playable characters, each with a different theme. </p>
                    <p>The Ironclad is the prototypical warrior, often using builds focused around increasing strength to defeat enemies and innate post-combat healing to survive the long journey. The Silent is a rogue designed to use either high numbers of low-damage attacks to whittle down enemies or stacking poison damage to quickly dispose of them. Her relatively small health pool is protected by weakening enemies and using clever tricks to avoid attacks entirely. The Defect is an automaton that became self-aware, using an ancient orb-manipulation technology to strike down foes. He has access to three orb types, which allow him to do instant damage, hold an orb that gains power over time for a one-time burst, or create shields to block enemy damage. The last character, the Watcher, is only unlockable after beating the game with each of the other characters. She has a unique high-risk playstyle centered on stance-switching. She can go on the offensive and deal double damage, but she also takes double damage. Leaving her “focus” stance gives her additional energy to attack, and her special “divinity” stance allows her to deal triple damage with no downside other than the difficulty of getting into the stance. </p>

                    <p class="first-paragraph">Upon entering the spire, you are greeted by Neow, a giant whale that blesses you with a bonus based on your previous run’s success. So long as you have defeated the first of the three main bosses, you receive a higher-tier bonus. You then begin your climb with a starter deck, which is the same throughout all runs. Each character has a slightly different starter deck, lending itself to the unique playstyle of that character. As you climb and defeat enemies, you are rewarded with card offerings and relics to improve your chances of victory. </p>
                    <p>Card rewards and relics are tiered by rarity. They can be considered Common, Uncommon, or Rare. There are also special events that can give you cards that are not classified under the normal rarities, which are only available from these special events. As you would expect, the power of the cards is often based on the rarity, and therefore you get the most powerful cards less often. However, Slay the Spire does not stick to the “rarer is always better” trope. The power of your deck is based on how well the cards you’ve gathered interact with each other. Oftentimes common cards are vital and you will want multiple copies of a card in your deck. There are many instances when a rare card will be useless to you, even making your deck weaker by restricting your ability to use your more important cards. Fortunately, you can always skip rewards. Relics play by the same rules, though they tend to be beneficial in most circumstances. Rarely will you want to skip a relic. They offer unique powerups, such as applying additional debuffs, allowing you to draw more cards, decreasing the cost of cards, and increasing the power of the cards. Because rewards are semi-random, you will not always find the best cards and relics by defeating enemies. Mega Crit helps to alleviate this by offering shops as alternative stops on you climb up the spire. </p>

                    <p class="first-paragraph">Slay the Spire has become one of my all-time favorite games. Across my saves on PC and the mobile port, I have nearly 500 hours played. The nature of roguelites keeps each playthrough fresh, and the massive number of unique cards and relics offers endless opportunities to theory-craft new, strong builds. The gameplay is simple and easy to pick up, and the game uses a small leveling system as an introduction. Until you reach level five, which likely will take fewer than 10 tries on a character, the card pool is limited. Mega Crit does this intentionally to ease players into the game while also showcasing the way that cards interact with each other. It also shows the value of common and uncommon cards, as many of the rare cards are initially unavailable. Though by no means an easy game, this short intro is helpful to all players as they are exposed to the nuances the spire offers. </p>
                    <p>After putting hundreds of hours into this game, I have fallen in love with it. The art styles are unique to each character, using a simple, dark color palette to remind you of the danger you face with each battle. The card art is excellent, and if you progress far enough you unlock the beta art for the cards, which is always a fun break. The depth of gameplay is what has truly garnered a massive, dedicated fanbase. The fact that each run presents an opportunity to use new strategies to defeat enemies, and the reward of one-shotting elite enemies and bosses, gives players endless chances to flood their brains with serotonin. Creativity is rewarded in Slay the Spire, as changing your strategy based on the rewards you are given is the only way to be successful. Slay the Spire is a masterpiece, and widely considered to be one of the best games ever released in its genre. Five stars. </p>
